        <p>"Nestor V. Diolzao was a great father, husband, and grandfather. He had two daughters named Jovelyn Diolazo and June Berbon, and his wife was Belinda Diolazo. He was a hardworking person, working tirelessly to provide for his family. When he was alive, he served as our chauffeur, 
            taking us to school and various places. He was always the one behind the wheel, ensuring we reached our destination safely. However, his sudden death on January 20, 2020, came as a big shock to us because it was unexpected. Many people, 
            especially his close and distant relatives, as well as his friends, were surprised by his passing."
