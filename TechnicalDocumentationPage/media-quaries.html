            <h3>Media Quaries</h3>
            <p>Media queries are CSS features that allow you to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device or viewport, such as screen size, resolution, and orientation. 
                They are commonly used for creating responsive designs.</p>

            <p>The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.</p>
            <p>mdeia quaries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a types of device, They look at the capability of the device</p>
            <p>Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>width and height of the viewport</li>
                <li>orientation of the viewport (landscape or portrait)</li>
                <li>resolution</li>
                <p>Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones)</p>

            <p>One way to use media queries is to have an alternate CSS section right inside your style sheet.</p>
            <p>The following example changes the background-color to lightgreen if the viewport is 480 pixels wide or wider (if the viewport is less than 480 pixels, the background-color will be pink):</p>
            
            <pre><code>
                @media screen and (min-width: 400){
                    body {
                        background-color: lightgreen
                    }
                }
            </code><pre>
